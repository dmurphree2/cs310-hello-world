# cs310-hello-world

This program prints the phrase "Hello World!" upon being called in the command line or in Java.

Class1.java and Class2.java have the same private void f1 - f3 as the primary file, and are
called by the HelloWorld.java file.

HelloWorld.java calls the class files within the initial variables under public static void
main(String[] args), though these classes aren't used for anything. I don't remember what
I was trying to accompish with these back when I initially took this class. The system prints
"Hello World!" before ending.
